### Simple HTML/CSS/JS boilerplate to kickstart Progressive Web App Projects

[Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) are beautiful because they can create a native app experience with HTML CSS and JavaScript. The goal of Cub PWA is to have a simple starting place for Progressive Web Apps without having to rely on a JavaScript framework.

Cub has predefined CSS classes such as `.cub-header`, `.cub-card`, `.cub-button`, and `.cub-fab`
